HWM (Home Work Movement)
========================
This is a project about Car Pooling.
The major purpose of HWM is the "Metodi di Ottimizzazione per la Logistica" 
exam ("Optimization Methods for Logistics" is a course about mathematical models 
and algorithms for optimal decision making in logistics domain; also modeling 
techniques and optimization algorithms for fundamental problems in logistics 
are introduced. For more infos please visit 
http://www.or.unimore.it/corsi/MOL/MOL.html).

The project is composed of HWM_solver and HWM_test_generator, which are 
two applications written in Java (.jar archive downloadable in 
[Packages](https://github.com/TheJena/HWM/tree/master/Packages) )

In [Presentation](https://github.com/TheJena/HWM/tree/master/Presentation) you 
can find several infos about the project.


Usage
=====

First of all download from 
[Packages](https://github.com/TheJena/HWM/tree/master/Packages) the solver and 
the test generator JAR archives.
Then open a terminal emulator and launch the following command to generate some 
inputs:
```
java -jar HMW_test_generator.jar
```
Or if you alredy have an inputfile.dat (some examples are available 
[here](https://github.com/TheJena/HWM/tree/master/Tests)) launch:
```
java -jar HWM_solver.jar
```
